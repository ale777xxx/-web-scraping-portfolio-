# Scraping Ethics & Legal Considerations

- Respect `robots.txt` and website terms of service.
- Keep request rates reasonable (AutoThrottle, delays).
- Identify yourself via a contact email in the User-Agent when appropriate.
- Never scrape personal data without consent; avoid PII.
- Cache data to reduce load; avoid hammering endpoints.
- Provide opt-out mechanisms for target sites when building internal tools.
